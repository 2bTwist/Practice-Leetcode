# LeetCode Practice Questions (SOLVED!)

This repo contains all the leetcode problems I have been practicing on for Technical Interviews.

## How is it Unique
  - Contains, BruteForce, Sub-optimal and Optimal Solution for each problem
  - Ability to add test cases use the test_cases.txt file for each problem
  - Displays runtime and space occupied for each problem(Play around with the type of solutions to see how these change)
  - Comments explaining what each important line does

## Reason for Project
When I started practicing leetcode, I was looking a resource where I can use to find and test every solution. Visually seeing how each solution both affects the runtime and space on the computer. So I decided to create this!
Hopefully it helps you in your journey!


## Note
Will be updating more questions as I go through them, please be patient
